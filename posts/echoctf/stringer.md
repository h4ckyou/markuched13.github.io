We're given a netcat server to connect to 

```
Connect: nc 10.0.14.28 1337
```

Connecting to it shows a server

Giving it any input prints back its content

From the box name `stringer` its likely a service which is vulnerable to format string vulnerability

Lets confirm it by leaking addresses off the stack using `%s`

Cool we get a flag 

Now that we've confirmed its a format string vulnerability the idea is to start leaking off values off the stack till we get all flags needed

But obviously we can do this `%1$s` which will print the content of the first string offset

And we can keep on going on

Not all the offset will have a value stored in it but yet we can keep on leaking that way

Doing it manually sucks and its time wasting

So i made a script to help me do it

Here's my leak script [Leak](https://github.com/markuched13/markuched13.github.io/blob/main/solvescript/echoctf/stringer/leak.py)

What it will do is to loop from 1 to 99 and keep on sending `%i$s` where `i` is the value iterated which is from `1-99`

Running it works but since my internet connection is really slow it keeps on disconnecting to the remote server

But eventually after few minutes i got the script to leak the flag and i then made just a one linear bash script to only leak the flag

Here's the solve script [Solve](https://github.com/markuched13/markuched13.github.io/blob/main/solvescript/echoctf/stringer/solve.sh)

Running it works

And we're done ðŸ‘»
