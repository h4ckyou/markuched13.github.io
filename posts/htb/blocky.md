Welcome everyone. The site and server are still under construction so donâ€™t expect too much right now!
We are currently developing a wiki system for the server and a core plugin to track player stats and stuff.
Lots of great stuff planned for the future ðŸ™‚
```

Now we know that this web server uses wordpress 

To confirm i'll check wappalyzer
