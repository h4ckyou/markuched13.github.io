From the scan we see that theres only 2 ports open

We have a telnet service running an a web http server

#### Enumerating Port 23

Checking it shows this

```
â””â”€$ telnet 192.168.232.159 23
Trying 192.168.232.159...
Connected to 192.168.232.159.

```

It looks interesting and from this what we would likely want to get is the admin password

But on problem it requires password

```
â””â”€$ telnet 192.168.232.159 23

From the hint it seems like if we get it we will be given a password 

Searching for the meaning of zodiac and the examples leads [here](https://www.britannica.com/topic/zodiac)

There are different types of examples given so i just put it in a script to get the correct one instead of doing it manually [Solve](https://github.com/markuched13/markuched13.github.io/blob/main/solvescript/pg/sona/zodiac_brute.py)

I got issues with receiving the correct value cause of new lines i couldn't figure it out but hey it works in debug mode ðŸ˜œ

Running it shows that the correct value of the zodiac sign is `leo`

 Cool we can also verify it by inputting the value from the telnet session

Now we need the favourite colour I made another brute force script which also i had issues with lines lol

Here's the script [Solve](https://github.com/markuched13/markuched13.github.io/blob/main/solvescript/pg/sona/color_brute.py)

Running it shows that the colour is `black`

I know that the required password is correct but no i need the password to access the RECOVER function 

After trying few combinations of `leo` & `black` It lead me to the correct one which is `blackleo`
