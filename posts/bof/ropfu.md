vuln: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, BuildID[sha1]=3aa2bb6a5bf44d90a355da83fa909bbf5d9d90ce, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped

[*] '/home/mark/Documents/Pentest/BOF/03-begineer_bof/ropfu/vuln'
    Arch:     i386-32-little
    RELRO:    Partial RELRO
    Stack:    Canary found
    NX:       NX disabled
    PIE:      No PIE (0x8048000)
    RWX:      Has RWX segments
```

We're working with a x86 binary, and from the checking the protections we see that there's no canary present and NX is disabled this means that we can inject shellcode to the stack and execute it

Source code is given

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

#define BUFSIZE 16

void vuln() {
  char buf[16];
  printf("How strong is your ROP-fu? Snatch the shell from my hand, grasshopper!\n");
  return gets(buf);

}

int main(int argc, char **argv){

  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
  

  // Set the gid to the effective gid
  // this prevents /bin/sh from dropping the privileges
  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  vuln();
  
}
```

Nothing much going on the main function just calls the vuln function and the vuln function prints out some words then use gets() to receive our input

The problem is the usage of get in the program. get() doesn't validate the amount of bytes passed in and from the code we see that the input buffer can only contain 16bytes of data but since get is used we can overflow it and cause a buffer overflow

From the challenge title its called `ROPFU` so basically this is a ROP chall `Return-Oriented-Programming`
